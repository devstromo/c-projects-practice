# C Programming Projects

## Overview

Welcome to my C programming projects repository! The primary objective of this repository is to learn C programming, as I'm currently a beginner. I'll progressively work on solving problems ranging from beginner to advanced levels, aiming to strengthen my understanding of the language and problem-solving skills.

## Goals

* **Learn C fundamentals:** I'll start with simple programs to understand the basics of C, such as data types, loops, and functions.
* **Intermediate challenges:** Once I'm comfortable with the basics, I'll tackle more complex problems, including file handling, data structures, and algorithms.
* **Advanced topics:** In the later stages, I plan to work on harder problems that involve memory management, pointers, and multi-threading.

## Project Structure

Each project is categorized by its difficulty level:

* `beginner/`: Simple programs covering basic syntax, input/output operations, loops, and conditionals.
* `medium/`: Intermediate problems that involve more complex algorithms, data structures, and file handling.
* `hard/`: Advanced projects, such as implementing algorithms (sorting, searching), memory management, and solving real-world problems.

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devstromo/c-projects-practice.git
    cd c-projects
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder of your choice:

    ```bash
    cd beginner/
    ```

3. Compile the code using a C compiler:

    ```bash
    gcc -o outputfile sourcefile.c
    ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

    ```bash
    ./outputfile
    ```

## Future Plans

* Expand the repository with additional beginner to advanced problems.
* Explore data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs.
* Work on real-world problems that involve system programming.

## Contributions

As I'm still learning, contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have suggestions or improvements.
